    "\n",
    "For extant (living) species, reconstructing phylogeny has come to rely primarily on **DNA sequences** -- initially, just sequences of single genes, but now, increasingly, on genome-scale data sets of hundreds or thousands of genes. We will learn the basics in upcoming labs, but to begin we will get acquainted with scientific computing in general, including files and file formats, and how to find and download DNA sequence data (and some morphological data) from public respositories."

    "\n",
    "If your work with computers to date has mostly involved double-clicking on file icons to open them in programs like Word or Photoshop, you might not appreciate the difference between [binary files](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_file) and [text files](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_file). An accessible yet detailed explanation can be found [here](https://www.nayuki.io/page/what-are-binary-and-text-files), but the main distinction is that text files are organized fundamentally by _lines_ (rows) of _characters_ (letters, numbers, and so on), and are generally meant to be human-readable.\n",
    "\n",
    "> ***Bottom line:*** text files are the bread-and-butter of scientific data analysis; they are used for source code and scripts, and often for data storage. In phylogenetics, ***all data files are text files***.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Text file formats\n",
    "\n",
    "The _format_ of a file refers to how its contents are structured. Whereas binary file formats are commonly specific to particular programs -- you can't open a Word document in Photoshop, for example -- a text file of any format can be opened in a text editor (e.g., TextEdit, Sublime Text, Atom, and for the diehards, Emacs and Vim). ***(Note: Word is not a text editor!)*** A common text file format for tabular data is [CSV](https://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch001356.htm). In phylogenetics, there are various text file formats for data, trees, and so on, that we will see in time."
