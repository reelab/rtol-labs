    "DNA sequences are the raw data used by many evolutionary biologists to reconstruct the evolutionary Tree of Life.  While some use phenotypic characters (primarily paleontologists) to construct phylogenies and explore evolutionary trends, most studying extant organisms use DNA sequence data.  We will learn more about how to analyze these data in upcoming labs, but here we begin by learning some basic commands in useful languages, and how to search for and access publicly available DNA sequence data (and some morphological data).  By the end of the lab, you should be able to do the following:\n",

Specifically, these fragments are first assembled into _contigs_, which are known, contiguous sequences. Sometimes, _contigs_ are known to be a certain distance apart in the genome but the intervening sequence between these _contigs_ is unknown. These _contigs_ can be connected together into a single sequence by filling in the intervening sequence with unknown nucleotide characters (“N”). These longer, but N-rich sequences are _scaffolds_."
