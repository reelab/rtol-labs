    "Last week, you learned how to download sequences from GenBank. But how are you supposed analyze these sequences in a reasonable way? This week, you will learn how to **align** your sequences so you can later use them to infer processes about the evolutionary history of life.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of **alignment** is to line up **homologous** nucleotide or amino acid positions across individuals/species. Ensuring homology of sequence regions that we are comparing is very important, because otherwise we would be treating two different regions as the same, leading to potentially unreasonable conclusions. For example, if I wanted to infer relatedness between everyone in this class, I could choose one trait - say the right thumb. I would want to make sure that I always select the right thumb for each student in the class, and not the left thumb, or the eye, because the ways in which other traits differ may not be comparable to the variation in the right thumb. In other words - we don't want to compare apples and oranges (although both are delicious).\n",
    "\n",
    "While aligning sequences may sounds simple, it can actually be rather tricky. For instance, some loci (such as parts of the ribosomal DNA) tend to have many insertions and deletions across homologous regions between individuals and species, and the placement of homologous bases can become rather ambiguous."
