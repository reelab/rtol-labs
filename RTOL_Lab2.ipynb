    "# Lab 2: Homology and Sequence Alignment\n",
    "![apples and oranges](http://steelcityanesthesia.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/ApplesAndOranges_Part2Blog_20150407.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "* Manually align DNA sequences using Mesquite\n",
    "* Automatically align sequences using Clustal and MUSCLE\n",
    "* Use codon positions to guide alignment\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Last week, you learned how to download sequences from GenBank. This week, you will learn how to **align** them.\n",
    "\n",
    "As covered in lecture, the goal of **alignment** is to establish the **homology** of nucleotide (or amino acid) positions across the \"terminal taxa\" (a.k.a. operational taxonomic units, or OTUs) -- the individuals, populations, or species represented by the sequences of interest. (The positions of individual nucleotides or amino acids in a sequence are called **sites**.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Establishing homology is a critical step, because inferring phylogeny rests on the assumption that species' differences at a site reflect _ancestor-descendant evolutionary change_ (Darwin's \"descent with modification\"). That is, homologous sites in 2 species should trace their ancestry to the same site in the genome of their common ancestor. We don't want to compare apples and oranges! (Actually, this idiom doesn't work here: apples and oranges are, in fact, homologous in the sense that developmentally, they are both the gynoecium of the flower.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that variation in homologous sequences arises from 2 basic processes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **substitution**\n",
    "  * an ancestral nucleotide (or amino acid) is replaced by a different, derived one\n",
    "  * the length of the sequence does not change\n",
    "2. **insertions and deletions (\"indels\")**\n",
    "  * the addition and removal, respectively, of sites from a sequence\n",
    "  * possible causes include:\n",
    "    * DNA polymerase slippage\n",
    "\t* unequal crossing over\n",
    "\t* transposons\n",
    "  * the length of the sequence changes (obviously)\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, the more that sequences vary, the more difficult it is to align them.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Importing and Manually Aligning Sequences\n",
    "\n",
    "Last week, we downloaded sequences of the _wingless_ (wg) and long-wavelength rhodopsin (LWRh) genes for 43 species of ants, and saved them as FASTA files.\n",

ClustalW does _not_ have a GUI, and commands must be entered directly in the command line (like you did earlier in Terminal).

    "\n",
    "Now it's time to perform a multiple alignment. At the top, next to the \"Mode\" tab, there is the option of performing a \"multiple\" or \"profile\" alignment, the latter of which can be used when you already have an alignment and want to add sequences. But we want \"multiple alignment\".\n",

    "2. Reconstruct simple tree based on distance scores.\n",
    "3. Uses simple tree as a guide tree to calculate the alignment: Begins at tips with greatest similarity and aligns these, then proceeds \"up\" the tree, aligning subsequent sequences.\n",

    "So, how does the program actually determine alignments as it goes along? Yep, you guessed it! By trying to minimize the number of mismatches and gaps, thereby creating an \"optimal\" alignment.
